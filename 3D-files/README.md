# HodgePodge STL and STEP

For now this is a dumping ground for  prototypes, and should be considered as such.

Tolerances are definitively something that needs to be worked on.
So far I've printed everything on a super old Ultimkaker 2+ with Klipper and used exclusevily PLA from Add:North and 0.6 nozzle, not caring too much about quality

The Plates I consider fairly simple and will probably update to be a bit sturdier and have some more room at the edges for soldering diodes and such, but ive used them two times as is.
The rest are still WIP.
